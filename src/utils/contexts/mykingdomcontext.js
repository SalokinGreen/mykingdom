Year 0
Your father died, leaving his kingdom to you. What will you do?
> Buy a dragon.
Your advisors try to discourage you from buying a dragon. It seems that dragons are prone to roam and the region's history has proved that dragons cannot be controlled. But you don't listen to them. You are the King now, and you make the decisions.
The advisor arranges to purchase a young, hungry, and inexperienced dragon from a neighboring kingdom. He has dark scales and sharp talons.
You name the dragon "Blackscale" and put him in the royal stables.

Year 1
You are already in a tough spot, having spent most of your gold on the dragon.
You must prepare for the invasion.
> Increase taxes for more gold.
It is never pleasant to levy unnecessary taxes, but this is a matter of life and death. You increase the taxes, promising that this is a one-time situation. The people will find a way to cope.
In the end, the taxing decision has caused you to lose more love than you have gained in approval. However, the new funds have helped the power of your kingdom.

Year 2
Alas, rumors have spread across the lands of the increased taxes. Some people from the small cities and villages surrounding the capital have left, seeking a better life in a more caring kingdom.
They have taken their personal belongings and have built homes further up the mountains, effectively becoming a hill tribe. They are considered as uncivilized people now by the neighboring kingdoms, and you have lost control of them.
> Apologies to the people of my kingdom.
The apology is delivered to the small cities and villages, acknowledging the wrong decision.
You promised lower taxes for a period of a decade. People are pleased and approve you a little bit more.

Year 3
A moderately sized baron has rebelled and taken over the mountain. He holds the passage from the northern kings and queens, which would have been a significant income source.
The dragon has gone missing, never to be heard of again.
There is a swarm of locusts nearby that devours the crops of your small cities and villages.
Your primary city is all that remains, and there are whispers of unrest.
> Find my dragon.
After days of searching and waiting, the dragon has finally returned.
The dragon seems to have grown quite a lot. There's something different about him...
After a while of inspecting the dragon, you notice that his belly is slightly bigger than normal.
It seems Blackscale is pregnant with a dragonling!

Year 4
Years seem to be going by so quickly.
The dragon's belly grows bigger.
The kingdom is still reeling from the possible impact of the swarms of locusts.
> Lead my army against the locusts.
It is not the right time to lead an assault; you decide it's safer to send your army.
The journey to the swarms doesn't go well. Your troops suffer heavy losses, but in the end, the locusts are eradicated.
When they return home, your army is depleted by half.

Year 5
Devastation has swept across the land.
Cities are raided by bandits and beasts.
Plagues have broken out.
The situation is only getting worse...
With the power of your army decimated, the kingdom is weak and vulnerable.
You sit upon the throne, thinking...
> Pray to God.
You ask the citizens to pray for a miracle, and you pray yourself.
After the prayers, there is a hush that covers the kingdom.
No one speaks, only listen.
Listening as the heavens above start to grumble and thunder.
Lightning strikes the ground, and a beam of light engulfs the capital.
From the white light comes a horned figure.
God has answered your prayers!

Year 6
You thank God personally. God gives you a divine trumpet of healing and a wooden bow of justice.
They will come in useful.
As the priest leaves, it is then that you notice the growing belly of the dragon.
The dragon is due to lay eggs!
> Help the dragon give birth.
You assist the dragon through the process as best you can.
Some eggs are dropped and they break, but some remain intact.

Year 7
God has granted you favor in the eyes of your subjects. Your love has increased.
As the babies grow, the parent dragon becomes increasingly aggressive and defensive.
You should decide what to do with the babies.
> Tame them to become my loyal friends.
With much patience and careful training, you succeed.
The dragons are tamed and start to develop their personalities.
They love and trust you whole-heartedly.
[ Love: greatly increased; Power: neutral; Wealth: neutral ]`,

Year 8
Maybe you were a little too generous in the gifts you gave to God.
Another band of mercenaries has been deployed to the northern front.
But this is no ordinary band. These mercenaries are led by a knight and are clad from head to toe in steel.
The troops have been paid for a month's worth of combat. You hope it doesn't come to that.
> Send the dragons after them.
The dragons are relentless. They swoop down upon their prey, feasting on fresh meat.
Soon, the bloodied bodies of the knights are laid out in front of you.
But among the fallen is the armored knight. His armor has been crushed, yet he is still breathing.

Year 9
In the year following the war, the kingdom's finances suffer. There is not enough coin to pay the soldiers their wages.
The men and women on the battlefield are beginning to lose morale and confidence in the kingdom.
You are running low on allies and archers to defend the realm.
Your only saving grace is your growing horde of dragons.
> Hold a great speech for my people.
To speak to all your citizens, you climb atop the mountains and use a magical boon to amplify your voice.
You have managed to convince the people that peace is better than war.
That if they stay in their houses, safe and sound, they shall be rewarded when peace is restored.
Your words echo in their minds even as they go back to work.

Year 10
More news is coming in.
The mercenaries have occupied the mountain.
They have set up a camp and have begun to mine the land, turning it into a fortress.
But this is just the beginning.
Before you can act, the lead knight, who called himself the "Red Knight," has sent a messenger.
He has you surrounded and will not give up the mountain no matter what happens.
> Convince the Red Knight to join my side with showing off my power.
Your royal mages craft an illusion and project it across the battlefield, the Red Knight and his men bearing witness to the might of a true Dragon King.
They surrender peacefully and pledge their allegiance to your cause.
And thus, a new era for the land begins.
